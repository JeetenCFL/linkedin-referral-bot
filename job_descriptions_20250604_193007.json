    "description": "About the job\nAbout The Role\n\nRole Overview:\n\nAt Shopify, we are developing an innovative AI Personal Shopper designed to redefine the online shopping experience for buyers. Our aim is to provide an exceptional concierge service tailored to individual preferences and needs, revolutionizing how customers interact with Shop and Storefronts.\n\nLeveraging cutting-edge AI technology, including Large Language Models (LLM) and advanced machine learning algorithms, we will harness the power of data analytics and build upon the solid platform foundation of the Assistant projects in Shopify. This enables us to deliver personalized recommendations, exclusive offers, and insightful suggestions that cater to each user's unique taste. Our AI technology will analyze user behavior, preferences, and inventory levels in real-time, ensuring that shoppers receive highly relevant and customized suggestions. Our AI Personal Shopper will be an indispensable ally for every shopper, assisting with everything from curating outfits to finding the perfect gifts.\n\nTo expedite this effort, we are seeking Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) leads and individual contributors to join our team and help shape the future of online shopping. Together, we will create an unparalleled shopping experience that exceeds customer expectations and redefines the e-commerce landscape.\n\nYou and your team won't just be working on theoretical concepts – you'll be at the forefront of implementing AI systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. We're all about creating tangible solutions that make a real difference in the day to day lives of entrepreneurs.\n\nKey outputs:\n\nDeveloping and deploying Generative AI, natural language processing and machine learning models\nProducing system design and architecture of scalable AI/ML systems\nDesigning and implementing data pipelines for fine-tuning LLMs \nSolving high impact data problems and delivering business impact through data and machine learning products\nPrioritizing and communicating to technical and non-technical audiences alike\n\n\nQualifications:\n\nDemonstrated mastery building data products that use generative AI, RLHF and fine-tuning LLMs\nEnd-to-end experience of training, evaluating, testing and deploying machine learning products at scale\nExperience building data pipelines and driving ETL design decisions leveraging disparate data sources\nExperience with the following: Python, shell scripting, streaming and batch data pipelines, vector databases, DBT, BigQuery, BigTable or equivalent, orchestration tools\nExperience with running machine learning in parallel environments (e.g. distributed clusters, GPU optimization)\n\n\nThis role may require on-call work\n\nAbout Shopify\n\nOpportunity is not evenly distributed.

Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.\n\nThis is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.\n\nAbout You\n\nMoving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.\n\nBefore you apply, consider if you can:\n\nCare deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone\nExcel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth\nKeep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)\nBe resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change\nBring critical thought and opinion\nUse AI tools reflexively as part of your fundamental workflow\nEmbrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward\nWork digital-first for your daily work"

    "description": "About the job\nLead ML Innovation at the Frontier of Scientific Communication\n\nAt BioRender, we're not just building tools — we're changing how science is communicated, understood, and accelerated. Every day, scientists use BioRender to tell the story of a new vaccine, cancer therapy, or fundamental biological discovery. Your work will help make those breakthroughs understandable to collaborators, investors, clinicians, students, and even the public — and ultimately get discoveries to market faster.\n\nWe're looking for a visionary Head of ML to help us build something extraordinary: tools that transform how scientific knowledge is created, shared, and understood. This isn't just about making pretty pictures – it's about democratizing scientific knowledge and accelerating discovery on a global scale.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nScientists are struggling to communicate their work in a world drowning in information. The tools they use to visualize and explain their research haven't fundamentally changed in decades. We're changing that.\n\nOur tools are already used by over a million scientists worldwide. With over 24 million scientific figures created, no one else has our depth of experience in scientific communication. Over 3 million researchers at the world’s top universities, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific journals rely on us every day to help them communicate their work.\n\nBut we're just getting started. With ML, we can create tools that fundamentally change how scientific knowledge is created and shared – making it more accessible, understandable, and impactful for everyone.\n\nWhat You’ll Build\n\nAs BioRender’s Head of ML, you’ll lead the transformation of figure creation from a manual, expert-driven process into one that’s intelligent, intuitive, and automated — without compromising scientific accuracy or visual quality. You’ll architect systems that deeply understand biological language, experimental context, and visual storytelling. You will:\n\nInvent and scale ML-powered figure generation that converts natural language descriptions (e.g. “Create a figure of a tissue sample preparation protocol”) into accurate, editable, and publication-ready scientific figures.\nDesign multimodal learning systems that understand the relationships between biological text, icons, diagrams, and templates — and generate figures grounded in scientific semantics, not just visual patterns.\nBuild generative visual models that learn from BioRender’s proprietary dataset: tens of millions of labeled scientific icons, diagrams, templates, and user-generated figures — the world's richest corpus of visual scientific knowledge.\nDevelop user-facing creative ML tools that scientists trust and love — from intelligent figure auto-complete and layout optimization, to context-aware suggestions and scientific diagram summarization.\nShip high-impact ML infrastructure that powers new experiences across BioRender's ecosystem — from slide generation and visual storyboarding to contextual education and scientific communication in new formats.\n\nAll of this will be built within the constraints of scientific accuracy, user editability, and domain trust — a challenge as hard as it is meaningful.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou're an ML leader with a rare combination of technical depth and user obsession. You’re excited to take on some of the hardest UX and ML challenges in visual creativity — in a domain (biology) where getting it right matters. You might be a strong fit if:\n\nYou’ve built and led frontier ML teams in areas like generative modeling, computer vision, or multimodal learning — and shipped products with millions of users.\nYou deeply understand generative models (transformers, diffusion, image/text embedding models, etc.) and have applied them to real-world creative workflows — especially where visual accuracy and human-in-the-loop tooling matter.\nYou think beyond models. You know success is measured in delight, trust, and adoption by real users. You think holistically about model training, UX scaffolding, latency tradeoffs, prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and safety/guardrails.\nYou’re curious about biology and motivated by the idea of helping scientists share their discoveries faster, clearer, and further. Experience in life sciences is a bonus, but not required.\nYou lead with clarity and ambition. You set technical vision, rally world-class ML talent, and prioritize ruthlessly to drive toward step-change innovation, not incremental improvements.\n\nWhy BioRender?\n\nA data and domain moat you can’t find anywhere else\n\nBioRender is the only company in the world with this kind of data:\n\n30M+ professionally curated scientific icons and components\nTop quartile for profitability and revenue growth, users in 200+ countries\nMillions of annotated user-generated figures and templates, spanning every field of biology\nDeep semantic metadata about biological systems, experimental techniques, and visual storytelling conventions\nA product scientists already love. We’re not starting from zero. BioRender is used by over 1.5 million scientists at 800+ institutions and every top pharma company. NPS scores rival the best creative tools in the world. With the trust and adoption of the scientific community, we’re uniquely positioned to introduce ML into scientific workflows in a way that feels magical — not disruptive.\nWork your way: Remote-first with team members across North America (and a Toronto office if you want it)\n\nWe care about what you can do, not how you learned to do it. If you're excited about using ML to transform scientific communication, we want to talk – regardless of your background or path.\n\nBioRender is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status."
