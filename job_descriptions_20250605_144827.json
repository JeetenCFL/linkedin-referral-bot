With over 24 million scientific figures created, no one else has our depth of experience in scientific communication. Over 3 million researchers at the world\u2019s top universities, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific journals rely on us every day to help them communicate their work.\n\nBut we're just getting started. With ML, we can create tools that fundamentally change how scientific knowledge is created and shared \u2013 making it more accessible, understandable, and impactful for everyone.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Build\n\nAs BioRender\u2019s Head of ML, you\u2019ll lead the transformation of figure creation from a manual, expert-driven process into one that\u2019s intelligent, intuitive, and automated \u2014 without compromising scientific accuracy or visual quality. You\u2019ll architect systems that deeply understand biological language, experimental context, and visual storytelling. You will:\n\nInvent and scale ML-powered figure generation that converts natural language descriptions (e.g. \u201cCreate a figure of a tissue sample preparation protocol\u201d) into accurate, editable, and publication-ready scientific figures.\nDesign multimodal learning systems that understand the relationships between biological text, icons, diagrams, and templates \u2014 and generate figures grounded in scientific semantics, not just visual patterns.\nBuild generative visual models that learn from BioRender\u2019s proprietary dataset: tens of millions of labeled scientific icons, diagrams, templates, and user-generated figures \u2014 the world's richest corpus of visual scientific knowledge.\nDevelop user-facing creative ML tools that scientists trust and love \u2014 from intelligent figure auto-complete and layout optimization, to context-aware suggestions and scientific diagram summarization.\nShip high-impact ML infrastructure that powers new experiences across BioRender's ecosystem \u2014 from slide generation and visual storyboarding to contextual education and scientific communication in new formats.\n\nAll of this will be built within the constraints of scientific accuracy, user editability, and domain trust \u2014 a challenge as hard as it is meaningful.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou're an ML leader with a rare combination of technical depth and user obsession. You\u2019re excited to take on some of the hardest UX and ML challenges in visual creativity \u2014 in a domain (biology) where getting it right matters. You might be a strong fit if:\n\nYou\u2019ve built and led frontier ML teams in areas like generative modeling, computer vision, or multimodal learning \u2014 and shipped products with millions of users.\nYou deeply understand generative models (transformers, diffusion, image/text embedding models, etc.) and have applied them to real-world creative workflows \u2014 especially where visual accuracy and human-in-the-loop tooling matter.\nYou think beyond models. You know success is measured in delight, trust, and adoption by real users. You think holistically about model training, UX scaffolding, latency tradeoffs, prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and safety/guardrails.\nYou\u2019re curious about biology and motivated by the idea of helping scientists share their discoveries faster, clearer, and further. Experience in life sciences is a bonus, but not required.\nYou lead with clarity and ambition. You set technical vision, rally world-class ML talent, and prioritize ruthlessly to drive toward step-change innovation, not incremental improvements.\n\nWhy BioRender?\n\nA data and domain moat you can\u2019t find anywhere else\n\nBioRender is the only company in the world with this kind of data:\n\n30M+ professionally curated scientific icons and components\nTop quartile for profitability and revenue growth, users in 200+ countries\nMillions of annotated user-generated figures and templates, spanning every field of biology\nDeep semantic metadata about biological systems, experimental techniques, and visual storytelling conventions\nA product scientists already love. We\u2019re not starting from zero. BioRender is used by over 1.5 million scientists at 800+ institutions and every top pharma company. NPS scores rival the best creative tools in the world. With the trust and adoption of the scientific community, we\u2019re uniquely positioned to introduce ML into scientific workflows in a way that feels magical \u2014 not disruptive.\nWork your way: Remote-first with team members across North America (and a Toronto office if you want it)\n\nWe care about what you can do, not how you learned to do it. If you're excited about using ML to transform scientific communication, we want to talk \u2013 regardless of your background or path.\n\nBioRender is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status.",

For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n\nU.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.\n\nEmployees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco\u2019s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco\u2019s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.\n\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:\n\n75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;\n\n1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;\n\n1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.\n\nFor non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",
